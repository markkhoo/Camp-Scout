## Motivation 
Iâ€™ve always run into problems going to a hiking spot. The weather is sometimes bad or the trail is closed. If only there was an app that puts together all of these considerations. No hiking or trail app will provide you with weather information on the day you plan to visit.

## Summary
Trail Scout is an interactive application that allows users to search for trails by city name. What this means is that a user can search for trials by simply inputting the name of the city and the application returns a list of trails within a 100 mile radius. The application also returns weather information such as temperature, humidity, air quality, and weather icons for easy visualization.

The user is then able to browse through all of the results and pick a trail that looks interesting. When the user selects a trail and clicks on the trail card, the user is then redirected to a details page. In the details page, the user will find more information on the specific trail the user clicked. Information such as trail description, trail rating, trail difficulty, a photo of the trail, and a five day weather forecast of the trail.
